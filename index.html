        <h1>Labyrinth</h1>
        <p><b>Labyrinth</b> refers to a complex and confusing series of pathways or passages, often used synonymously with a <i>maze</i>. Historically, the labyrinth is symbolic of a journey or pilgrimage, leading to personal transformation.</p>
        <p>The most well-known labyrinth is the mythological structure designed by Daedalus in Crete to contain the Minotaur. Over time, labyrinths have appeared in numerous cultures and media, often representing a puzzle, challenge, or spiritual journey.</p>
        <p>Unlike mazes, traditional labyrinths typically have only one path leading to the <a href="doorway.html" id="secret-link">entrance</a> and then to the center, without branches or dead ends. Mazes, on the other hand, include multiple paths, choices, and often misleading passages.</p>
        <h2>Modern Usage</h2>
        <p>Labyrinths are still constructed today for therapeutic, recreational, or ceremonial purposes. In literature and games, the labyrinth is frequently a symbol of entrapment or introspection.</p>
